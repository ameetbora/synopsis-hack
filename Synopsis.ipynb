        "Knowledge sharing sessions are crucial for the success and growth of any functional team. These sessions facilitate the transfer of expertise, promote collaboration, and ensure that everyone stays updated with the latest developments and best practices. Traditionally, these sessions are conducted through platforms like Teams or Zoom. However, once the recorded session concludes, there often isn't a documentary trail available to follow up on the tutorials. This lack of documentation can hinder the team's ability to revisit important information and apply the learnings effectively.\n",

        "Team Synopsis has developed an innovative solution to address this gap. Our system takes any recorded session in MP4 format, comprehends the context of the video, and generates comprehensive tutorial documents based on the step-by-step instructions demonstrated in the video. This automated process ensures that every important detail from the knowledge sharing sessions is captured and documented, providing a valuable resource for team members to refer back to at any time. By transforming video content into structured tutorial documents, we make learning more accessible and sustainable for the entire team."

        "\n",
        "This function is designed to take an MP4 video file as input, encode its content in Base64 format, and store the encoded string in a text file. This process is useful for various purposes, such as transferring video data over mediums that only support text formats or preparing the data for further processing by other systems that require Base64 encoding.\n",

        "\n",
        "*Reading the Video File*: The function starts by opening the specified MP4 video file in binary read mode. This allows it to read the raw byte content of the video file.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Encoding to Base64*: The raw video data is then encoded to Base64 using Python's built-in base64 module. The b64encode method converts the binary data into a Base64 encoded byte string.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Converting to String*: The Base64 encoded byte string is decoded into a regular string using the decode('utf-8') method, making it suitable for writing to a text file.\n",

        "*Writing to Text File*: The function opens the specified output text file in write mode and writes the Base64 encoded string to it.\n",
