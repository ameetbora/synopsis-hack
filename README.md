Introduction:

Knowledge sharing sessions are crucial for the success and growth of any functional team. These sessions facilitate the transfer of expertise, promote collaboration, and ensure that everyone stays updated with the latest developments and best practices. Traditionally, these sessions are conducted through platforms like Teams or Zoom. However, once the recorded session concludes, there often isn't a documentary trail available to follow up on the tutorials. This lack of documentation can hinder the team's ability to revisit important information and apply the learnings effectively.

Solution:

Team Synopsis has developed an innovative solution to address this gap. Our system takes any recorded session in MP4 format, comprehends the context of the video, and generates comprehensive tutorial documents based on the step-by-step instructions demonstrated in the video. This automated process ensures that every important detail from the knowledge sharing sessions is captured and documented, providing a valuable resource for team members to refer back to at any time. By transforming video content into structured tutorial documents, we make learning more accessible and sustainable for the entire team.
